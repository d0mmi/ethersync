# Working with Vim's EOL behavior

## Context and Problem Statement

Es gibt da einen Bug: Wenn Daemon-seitig eine page mit einem \n endet, und man sie in Vim öffnet, existiert die Newline in Vim nur implizit. Führt dazu, dass zB beim Content "a\n" ein insert(2, "x") vom daemon aus in Vim zu "ax\n" wird.
Um das zu fixen, müssten wir entweder:
- Das newline beim Öffnen der Datei einfügen (und verhindern, dass Vim das mitspeichert), oder
- Mit der eol-Option rumspielen, sodass sie korrekt wiederspiegelt, wie der Dateiinhalt tatsächlich ist (und vermutlich fixeol lokal ausmachen).

Reproduzieren mittels:

-  Buffer hat nur ein "x\n" wenn die Datei geöffnet wird

```
vim.api.nvim_create_user_command("EthersyncInsert", function()
    print(vim.fn.strchars(utils.contentOfCurrentBuffer()))
    local row, col = utils.indexToRowCol(2)
    print(row, col)
    utils.insert(2, "a")
end, {})
```
=> Resultat: Es wird bei "1" eingefügt, weil vim "denkt", dass der Buffer nur aus "x" besteht (wird geclippt in charOffsetToByteOffset).

We have to support the following cases:
- file content is "x" (without a newline)
    - when openend with vim, EOL will be false
    - vim writes its buffer and "fixeol" triggers writing an EOL (which is not yet communicated to daemon)
- file content is "x\n" (with a newline)
    - when openend with vim, EOL will be true
- Some other editor removes the implicit \n while vim runs
- Some other editor adds a \n while vim runs
    - this should already work?

## Decision Drivers

* {decision driver 1, e.g., a force, facing concern, …}
* {decision driver 2, e.g., a force, facing concern, …}
* … <!-- numbers of drivers can vary -->

## Considered Options

* Always force 'eol' and 'fixeol' off.
* When 'fixeol' is on, send the fixes a Vim write would make to the daemon immediately.
* … <!-- numbers of options can vary -->

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "{title of option 1}", because
{justification. e.g., only option, which meets k.o. criterion decision driver | which resolves force {force} | … | comes out best (see below)}.

### Consequences

* Good, because {positive consequence, e.g., improvement of one or more desired qualities, …}
* Bad, because {negative consequence, e.g., compromising one or more desired qualities, …}
* … <!-- numbers of consequences can vary -->

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Always force 'eol' and 'fixeol' off.

Always force 'eol' and 'fixeol' off. When opening a file, and it contains a trailing \n, insert it in the buffer (but set 'eol' off).

* Good, because this allows us to display cursors in those empty new lines.
* Good, because it seems simple.
* Bad, because Vim will now always show line breaks at end of regular files, which is not what people are used to.

### When 'fixeol' is on, send the fixes a Vim write would make to the daemon immediately.

In our plugin, look at 'fixeol', to determine whether Vim will ever meddle with the file. If it is on (and 'eol' is false), already send an inserted \n to the daemon at the earliest possibility. This is as if Vim writes as soon as it openes the file. Set 'eol' to true in that case.

If any operation leaves us with a (real) content without a newline in the end, set 'eol' to false. But if 'fixeol' is true, immediately send the "fixing" \n to the daemon again.

* Good, because from Vim's point of view, the file behaves normally.
* Bad, because a cursor in a new, empty line can't be represented (probably?).
* Neutral, because it can lead to strange behavior when other clients delete the trailing newline. Our plugin will immediatel re-add it. But that might be what's to be expected.

Vim `:h eol` writes:

	When 'binary' is off and 'fixeol' is on the value is not used when
	writing the file.  When 'binary' is on or 'fixeol' is off it is used
	to remember the presence of a <EOL> for the last line in the file, so
	that when you write the file the situation from the original file can
	be kept.  But you can change it if you want to.
	See |eol-and-eof| for example settings.

Note: The `contentOfCurrentBuffer` function should probably always look at 'eol' to return the real, implied content.

Observation:

- Have a file not ending in \n.
- Open it in Vim. 'eol' will be off.
- Verify 'fixeol' is on.
- Write.
- File now ends in \n.
- But 'eol' is still on. :O So we can't really use it as a "does the last line have an implicit newline" indicator in this case.
- But in our solution, we can toggle that option on and off and assume it does.

Downside of solution where we just toggle 'eof' on and off depending on the "real" content:
If someone puts their cursor to a new empty line in the end, we wouldn't be able to display that cursor in Vim.
Maybe that's not so bad? Or we can find a workaround in that case?
